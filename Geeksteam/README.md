# Moroccan Traffic Violation Chatbot (Tchat)

## Abstract

### Background and Problem Statement
Understanding and adhering to traffic laws is essential for ensuring road safety and reducing violations. Many drivers in Morocco struggle with comprehending the traffic violation laws due to language barriers and the complexity of regulations. This often results in increased traffic violations and misunderstandings of legal consequences.

### Impact and Proposed Solution
The **Moroccan Traffic Violation Chatbot (Tchat)** addresses this issue by providing an accessible, multilingual chatbot that educates users about Moroccan traffic laws in **French** and **Arabic**. Leveraging advanced NLP and ML technologies, the chatbot categorizes traffic violations into 18 categories and offers user-friendly explanations tailored to the userâ€™s language preference. This solution promotes safer driving practices and empowers users with better knowledge of traffic laws.
In the [notebooks/analysis.ipynb](./notebooks/analysis.ipynb) We have explored that we can categorize the moroccan amendements to 18 category, after some feature engineering.
### Project Outcomes and Deliverables
1. **Interactive Chatbot**: Enables users to query Moroccan traffic laws.
2. **Categorized Traffic Violations**: Organized into 18 distinct categories for easy retrieval.
3. **Multilingual Responses**: Support for both French and Arabic.
4. **Backend System**: Built with Django for seamless integration.
5. **Frontend Interface**: Developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
6. **Embedding Database**: Powered by Pinecone for efficient data retrieval.
